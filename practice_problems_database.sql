-- 1) Duplicate Emails
-- Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.
--
-- +----+---------+
-- | Id | Email   |
-- +----+---------+
-- | 1  | a@b.com |
-- | 2  | c@d.com |
-- | 3  | a@b.com |
-- +----+---------+
-- For example, your query should return the following for the above table:
--
-- +---------+
-- | Email   |
-- +---------+
-- | a@b.com |
-- +---------+

SELECT
    Email
FROM
    Person
GROUP BY

HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1

-- 2) Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
-- The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
--
-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- | Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
-- | 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
-- | 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
-- | 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
--
-- +----------+
-- | Employee |
-- +----------+
-- | Joe      |
-- +----------+

SELECT
    first_table.name as Employee
FROM
    Employee as first_table
JOIN
    Employee as second_table
ON
    first_table.ManagerId = second_table.Id
WHERE
    first_table.Salary > second_table.Salary

-- 3) Combine Two Tables
--
-- Table: Person
--
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | PersonId    | int     |
-- | FirstName   | varchar |
-- | LastName    | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
-- Table: Address
--
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | AddressId   | int     |
-- | PersonId    | int     |
-- | City        | varchar |
-- | State       | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
--
-- Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:
--
-- FirstName, LastName, City, State

SELECT
    FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM
    Person
LEFT JOIN
    Address
ON
    Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId

-- 4) Customers Who Never Order
--
-- Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.
--
-- Table: Customers.
--
-- +----+-------+
-- | Id | Name  |
-- +----+-------+
-- | 1  | Joe   |
-- | 2  | Henry |
-- | 3  | Sam   |
-- | 4  | Max   |
-- +----+-------+
-- Table: Orders.
--
-- +----+------------+
-- | Id | CustomerId |
-- +----+------------+
-- | 1  | 3          |
-- | 2  | 1          |
-- +----+------------+
-- Using the above tables as example, return the following:
--
-- +-----------+
-- | Customers |
-- +-----------+
-- | Henry     |
-- | Max       |
-- +-----------+

SELECT
    Name as Customers
FROM
    Customers
LEFT JOIN
    Orders
ON
    Customers.Id = Orders.CustomerId
WHERE
    Orders.Id IS NULL
--
-- 5)  Rising Temperature
--
-- Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.
--
-- +---------+------------+------------------+
-- | Id(INT) | Date(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
-- +---------+------------+------------------+
-- |       1 | 2015-01-01 |               10 |
-- |       2 | 2015-01-02 |               25 |
-- |       3 | 2015-01-03 |               20 |
-- |       4 | 2015-01-04 |               30 |
-- +---------+------------+------------------+
-- For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:
-- +----+
-- | Id |
-- +----+
-- |  2 |
-- |  4 |
-- +----

SELECT
    today.Id
FROM
    Weather as today
JOIN
    Weather as yesterday
ON
    yesterday.Date = DATE_SUB(today.Date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE
    today.Temperature > yesterday.Temperature

-- 6) Second Highest Salary
--
-- Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
--
-- +----+--------+
-- | Id | Salary |
-- +----+--------+
-- | 1  | 100    |
-- | 2  | 200    |
-- | 3  | 300    |
-- +----+--------+
-- For example, given the above Employee table, the second highest salary is 200. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

SELECT
(SELECT
    DISTINCT Salary
FROM
    Employee
ORDER BY
    Salary DESC
LIMIT
    1
OFFSET
    1) AS SecondHighestSalary
